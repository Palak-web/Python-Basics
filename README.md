## Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to any module to explore the code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Palak-web/PYTHON-BASICS.git
cd PYTHON-BASICS
```

Run any Python file:
```bash
python "Basics/class 4, 5 First prog.py"
```

## Learning Path

1. Start with **Basics** to understand Python syntax and data types
2. Move to **Control Flow** for decision making
3. Learn **Data Structures** for data management
4. Study **Functions** for code organization
5. Practice **Loops** for iteration
6. Advance to **Advanced Basics** for OOP concepts
7. Apply knowledge through **Exercises**
